Unreleased
---------------------

2.2.1 (2020-10-14)
---------------------

Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* N/A

Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fix incorrect retrieval of *latest* ``Dataset`` due to invalid search criteria of ``FINISHED`` status.
  Both lower and upper naming variants will be employed for backward compatibility of existing ``Dataset`` entries.

2.2.0 (2020-10-01)
---------------------

Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Provide ``crop_mode`` parameter to ``BatchCreation`` process that specifies whether to generate ``extend``
  (pad crops to have squares), ``raw`` (original minimal rectangle) or ``reduce`` (clip bbox to make a square).
  When ``crop_fixed_size`` is not provided (has priority), ``crop_mode`` indicates how to generate the patches.
  Default is ``extend`` (most typical use case: square bbox of various sizes to be handled by preprocessing transforms).
  Previously, the minimal rectangle bounding box fitted to contain the annotated feature were directly used to generate
  non-squared patch crops. The dimensions are now adjusted to specification [GEOIM-238].
* All ``Dataset`` now only contain one type of patch crop (``fixed``, ``extend``, ``fixed``, ``reduce``) according to
  the parameters provided during ``BatchCreation`` request. Patches of ``fixed`` size are no longer added on top of the
  ``raw`` crops in the same ``Dataset``.
* Loads all ``crops`` of each ``patch`` within the ``Dataset`` as individual ``sample`` for the data loader.
  Crops where previously assumed to always be a list of a single item. They will support multiple if more are provided.
* Provide map of masked image labels to samples generated by the test data loader for ``Segmentation`` task.
* Add summary result reporting function extended by specialized ones for ``Classification`` and ``Segmentation`` tasks.
* Forward ``dontcare`` configuration parameters to the data loader for proper sample generation.
* Add more validation of input model task to have expected class IDs format matching taxonomy classes to map against.
* Add support of model upload using Google Drive shared file link.
* Enforce ``geoimagenet_ml.ml.data_trainer_device`` configuration to use the explicit device available.
  Don't rely on possibly unavailable/invalid device inferred from model checkpoint uploaded by external user.
* Update requirements to `crim-ca/gin-model-repo (1.0.1) <https://github.com/crim-ca/gin-model-repo/tree/1.0.1>`_
  and `thelper (v0.6.2) <https://github.com/plstcharles/thelper/tree/v0.6.2>`_ to employ latest updates at this time.

Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fix creation of crop masks as UINT8 black/white PNG images [GEOIM-337].
* Fix test runner for ``Classification`` task with adjustments to job update and other parameters incorrectly passed
  down during sample generation by the data loader.
* Revert erroneously removed implementation of data loader for ``Classification``
  (was overridden by ``Segmentation`` implementation in ``2.0.0``).
* Pin ``celery<5`` that breaks imports.

---------------------

Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  to facilitate import of corresponding utilities and model implementations

  (CLI script callable after install with ``gin_ml_run_model_tester``)
* add ``memory`` implementations of database stores for testing and scripts
* add support of ``Segmentation`` networks inference with corresponding dataset loader, metrics and tasks
* update ``thelper>=0.5.0`` requirement for latest changes and features

---------------------

* drop Sentry events in case of HTTP Client errors (4xx) to avoid over reporting expected responses by API

Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

---------------------

Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* add error logging in case of request generating an exception (voluntary or by execution problem)

* enforce ``thelper>=0.3.1`` to use new operation modes and back compatibility import methods
* add model checkpoint validation checks and raise ``ModelValidationError`` (``HTTP Forbidden [403]``) if invalid

  `batch-creation` execution to evaluate them against a registered model using process `model-tester`.
* add ``geoimagenet_ml.ml.jobs_path`` configuration setting to indicate where process job logging should be stored.
  (mostly during process `model-tester` execution)
